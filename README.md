- A booking is linked to one property.
- A booking can trigger one payment.

4. Reviews
Represents feedback left by users for properties.
Key Fields:
- id: Unique review identifier
- user: ForeignKey to User
- property: ForeignKey to Property
- rating: Integer (e.g., 1‚Äì5)

# Feature Breakdown
üßë‚Äçüíº User Management
Handles secure user registration, authentication, and profile updates. This feature ensures that both guests and hosts can manage their accounts safely, with role-based access and data protection.
üè† Property Management
Allows hosts to create, update, and manage property listings. It supports detailed descriptions, location tagging, and availability settings, forming the backbone of the platform‚Äôs accommodation offerings.
üìÖ Booking System
Enables users to reserve properties and manage booking details such as check-in and check-out dates. It ensures accurate availability tracking and prevents double bookings through validation and conflict resolution.
üí≥ Payment Processing
Facilitates secure transactions for property bookings. It records payment status, timestamps, and amounts, ensuring financial accountability and smooth user experience.
‚≠ê Review System
Lets users leave ratings and feedback on properties they‚Äôve stayed in. This builds trust in the platform and helps future guests make informed decisions based on real experiences.
üìä Data Optimization
Implements indexing and caching strategies to enhance performance. These optimizations reduce database load, speed up API responses, and ensure scalability as the platform grows.
üìò API Documentation
Provides clear, standardized documentation using OpenAPI and GraphQL. This ensures developers can easily integrate, test, and extend the backend functionality with confidence

# API Security
 Authentication
Uses token-based authentication (e.g., JWT or DRF TokenAuth) to verify user identity before granting access to protected endpoints. This prevents unauthorized access and ensures that only verified users can perform sensitive actions like booking or listing properties.
üõÇ Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures that users can only perform actions permitted by their role (e.g., host vs guest). For example, only hosts can create or manage property listings, while guests can book and review properties. This prevents privilege escalation and enforces platform rules.
üö¶ Rate Limiting
Limits the number of requests per user/IP within a defined time window to prevent abuse, brute-force attacks, and denial-of-service (DoS) scenarios. This helps maintain system stability and protects against malicious traffic.
üßä Data Encryption
Sensitive data such as passwords and payment details are encrypted both in transit (via HTTPS) and at rest (using hashing and secure storage). This protects user credentials and financial information from interception or leakage.
üßÆ Input Validation & Sanitization
All incoming data is validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS). This ensures that only clean, expected data enters the system, preserving database integrity and user safety.
üí≥ Secure Payment Handling
Payment endpoints are protected with additional verification layers and transaction logging. This ensures that financial operations are traceable, tamper-proof, and compliant with industry standards.


CI/CD Pipeline
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes. This ensures that every update to the backend is validated, secure, and production-ready‚Äîreducing manual errors and accelerating development cycles.
For the Airbnb Clone project, CI/CD pipelines are crucial for:
- ‚úÖ Automatically running tests to catch bugs early
- üöÄ Seamlessly deploying updates to staging or production environments
- üîÅ Maintaining consistency across development, testing, and deployment stages
Tools Used:
- GitHub Actions: Automates testing, linting, and deployment workflows directly from your GitHub repository.
- Docker: Ensures consistent environments across local development, CI pipelines, and production servers.
- Celery & Redis: Supports asynchronous task execution during deployment (e.g., sending notifications).
- Heroku / AWS / Render (optional): For hosting and deploying the backend services.
